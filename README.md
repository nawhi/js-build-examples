# JavaScript build examples

This repository is a work-in-progress explanation of how JavaScript build systems work.

It contains examples of commonly-seen applications, constructed to be simple enough that it's possible to see what the build tool is actually doing.

It helps to explain the following:
- what's JSX and why do I need to import React for it to work?
- how does typescript get changed to javascript?
- how do build tools convert modularised JS into a single file?
- how do build tools handle images and other media?
- what's the difference between require and import? (WIP)
- and more... (WIP)
