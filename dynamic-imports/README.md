# Dynamic imports

Dynamic imports is a common pattern in large single-page apps, or apps that load heavy libraries for a rare use case.

Most of the explanation for this one is in the app itself. Run `yarn serve` to get started.

_Please note - this is a contrived example. If you are actually building a translated web app, don't do it like this!_
